<p>I'm 6' 9&quot;. This doesn't just result in <a href="http://doyouplayball.tumblr.com">copious comments from strangers</a>, it also makes many activities difficult.</p>
<p>For the last 8 years, backpacking has been a pasttime. Due to the influence of my friend <a href="http://www.blueridgeoutdoors.com/biking/the-worlds-toughest-bike-race-on-a-singlespeed/">Ron Babington</a><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, I've been working towards building an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultralight_backpacking">ultralight pack</a>.</p>
<p>However, due to my height, the gear available to me is limited. When I thumb through <a href="http://www.backpacker.com/" title="Backpacker Magazine - Your Backpacking, Hiking, Camping and Outdoor Gear Magazine">Backpacker magazine</a>'s annual gear issue, I breeze past the shoes, jackets, shirts, pants, tents, sleeping bags, and packs because most of the items won't fit my long body.</p>
<h2 id="more-about-me">More about me</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Height</strong>: Just under 6' 10&quot; (approx. 208 CM)</li>
<li><strong>Weight</strong>: Approximately 260 lbs currently</li>
<li><strong>Inseam</strong>: 35&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Waist</strong>: approx. 37&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Shoe size</strong>: 16 US</li>
<li><strong>Shirt size</strong>: Medium or large extra tall<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="my-gear">My gear</h2>
<h3 id="pack">Pack</h3>
<p>I carry a tall <a href="http://www.zpacks.com/backpacks/arc_zip.shtml">ZPacks 54L Arc Zip</a>. It cost me $324.00 in 2015. It weights 1.3 lbs. It's very comfortable, and I love it.</p>
<h5 id="notes">Notes</h5>
<p><small>Before I started transitioning to ultralight backpacking, I carred a <a href="http://www.ula-equipment.com/product_p/catalyst.htm" title="CATALYST SHIPS FREE to US ADDRESSES">ULA Catalyst</a>. It cost me $235.00 in 2009.</small></p>
<h3 id="sleeping-quilt-and-mat">Sleeping quilt and mat</h3>
<p>I use a custom quilt made by <a href="https://goosefeetgear.com/">Goosefeet Gear</a>. It is overstuffed with 850 FP DownTek, in 1.75&quot; vertical baffles. There are snaps and a drawstring to create a footbox. Goosefeet sized it based on some measurements I gave them, and I am extremely happy with it. It weighs 1.5 lbs. It cost me $395 in 2014.</p>
<p>I use a <a href="http://gossamergear.com/air-beam-sleepers.html">Gossamer Gear Airbeam Sleeper</a> inflatable pad in the wide, torso length size. It cost me about $100 in 2014. It weights 0.9 pounds. I sometimes carry a 3 oz foam pad for extra insulation.</p>
<h5 id="notes-1">Notes</h5>
<p><small>Buying sleeping pads isn't too difficult since they often don't need length of your body. Buying a bag or quilt is much hard. I highly recommend finding a small shop like Goosefeet Gear to make one to your specs.</small></p>
<p><small>Before getting the quilt, I had the enormous and warm Sierra Designs Paul Bunyan mummy bag. It weighs 4 lbs!</small></p>
<h3 id="shelter">Shelter</h3>
<p>I sleep under a <a href="http://www.bearpawwd.com/">Bearpawwd</a> 8'x10' silnylon, rectangular tarp pitched between two trekking poles. It weights 1.1 pounds. It cost me $71.00 in 2015.</p>
<p>On the ground, I have a 105&quot;x48&quot; piece of 0.007&quot; thick Tyvek. It weighs 8 oz.</p>
<h5 id="notes-2">Notes</h5>
<p><small>Finding a tent that will fit me inside and keep me dry has been nearly impossible. An advantage of this shelter is that my wife and I can both fit under it easily.</small></p>
<p><small>I am considering buying a customized sized, cuben fiber bivy from <a href="http://borahgear.com">Borah Gear</a> as additional protection from wet ground and insects.</small></p>
<p><small>I have talked to some other manufacturers and modifying their tents. ZPacks and Hyperlite Mountain Gear are unable to customize tents on a one-off basis. <a href="http://www.yamamountaingear.com/">Yama Gear</a> <em>is</em> willing to add length to their Cirriform tents.</small></p>
<p><small>I <a href="https://backpackinglight.com/forums/topic/current-state-of-tents-for-the-very-tall">started a thread</a> on the topic of tents for the very tall at BPL. It's worth reading through.</small></p>
