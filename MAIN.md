# Ultralight Backpacking for the Ultratall

I'm 6' 9". This doesn't just result in [copious comments from strangers](http://doyouplayball.tumblr.com), it also makes many activities difficult.

For the last 8 years, backpacking has been a pasttime. Due to the influence of my friend [Ron Babington](http://www.blueridgeoutdoors.com/biking/the-worlds-toughest-bike-race-on-a-singlespeed/)[^ron], I've been working towards building an [ultralight pack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultralight_backpacking).

However, due to my height, the gear available to me is limited. When I thumb through [Backpacker magazine](http://www.backpacker.com/ "Backpacker Magazine - Your Backpacking, Hiking, Camping and Outdoor Gear Magazine")'s annual gear issue, I breeze past the shoes, jackets, shirts, pants, tents, sleeping bags, and packs because most of the items won't fit my long body.

## My gear

### Pack

I carry a tall [ZPacks 54L Arc Zip](http://www.zpacks.com/backpacks/arc_zip.shtml). It cost me $324.00 in 2015. It weights 1.3 lbs. It's very comfortable, and I love it.

#### Notes

<small>Before I started transitioning to ultralight backpacking, I carred a [ULA Catalyst](http://www.ula-equipment.com/product_p/catalyst.htm "CATALYST  SHIPS FREE to US ADDRESSES"). It cost me $235.00 in 2009.</small>

### Sleeping quilt and mat

I use a custom quilt made by [Goosefeet Gear](https://goosefeetgear.com/). It is overstuffed with 850 FP DownTek, in 1.75" vertical baffles. There are snaps and a drawstring to create a footbox. Goosefeet sized it based on some measurements I gave them, and I am extremely happy with it. It weighs 1.5 lbs. It cost me $395 in 2014.

I use a [Gossamer Gear Airbeam Sleeper](http://gossamergear.com/air-beam-sleepers.html) inflatable pad in the wide, torso length size. It cost me about $100 in 2014. It weights 0.9 pounds. I sometimes carry a 3 oz foam pad for extra insulation.

#### Notes

<small>Buying sleeping pads isn't too difficult since they often don't need length of your body. Buying a bag or quilt is much hard. I highly recommend finding a small shop like Goosefeet Gear to make one to your specs.</small>

<small>Before getting the quilt, I had the enormous and warm Sierra Designs Paul Bunyan mummy bag. It weighs 4 lbs!</small>

### Shelter

I sleep under a [Bearpawwd](http://www.bearpawwd.com/) 8'x10' silnylon, rectangular tarp pitched between two trekking poles. It weights 1.1 pounds. It cost me $71.00 in 2015.

On the ground, I have a 105"x48" piece of 0.007" thick Tyvek. It weighs 8 oz.

#### Notes

<small>Finding a tent that will fit me inside and keep me dry has been nearly impossible. An advantage of this shelter is that my wife and I can both fit under it easily.</small>

<small>I am considering buying a customized sized, cuben fiber bivy from [Borah Gear](http://borahgear.com) as additional protection from wet ground and insects.</small>

<small>I have talked to some other manufacturers and modifying their tents. ZPacks and Hyperlite Mountain Gear are unable to customize tents on a one-off basis. [Yama Gear](http://www.yamamountaingear.com/) _is_ willing to add length to their Cirriform tents.</small>

<small>I [started a thread](https://backpackinglight.com/forums/topic/current-state-of-tents-for-the-very-tall) on the topic of tents for the very tall at BPL. It's worth reading through.</small>



[^torso]: My legs aren't _that_ long given my height. My height comes mostly from a long torso. It makes finding shirts especially hard.
