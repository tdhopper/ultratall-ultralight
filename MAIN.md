# Ultralight Backpacking for the Ultratall

I'm 6' 9". This doesn't just result in [copious comments from strangers](http://doyouplayball.tumblr.com), it also makes many activities difficult.

For the last 8 years, backpacking has been a pasttime. Due to the influence of my friend [Ron Babington](http://www.blueridgeoutdoors.com/biking/the-worlds-toughest-bike-race-on-a-singlespeed/)[^ron], I've been working towards building an [ultralight pack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultralight_backpacking).

However, due to my height, the gear available to me is limited. When I thumb through [Backpacker magazine](http://www.backpacker.com/ "Backpacker Magazine - Your Backpacking, Hiking, Camping and Outdoor Gear Magazine")'s annual gear issue, I breeze past the shoes, jackets, shirts, pants, tents, sleeping bags, and packs because most of the items won't fit my long body.

[^torso]: My legs aren't _that_ long given my height. My height comes mostly from a long torso. It makes finding shirts especially hard.
