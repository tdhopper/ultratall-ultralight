# Ultralight Backpacking for the Ultratall

I'm 6' 9". This doesn't just result in [copious comments from strangers](http://doyouplayball.tumblr.com), it also makes many activities difficult.

For the last 8 years, backpacking has been a past time. Due to the influence of my friend [Ron Babington](http://www.blueridgeoutdoors.com/biking/the-worlds-toughest-bike-race-on-a-singlespeed/)[^ron], I've been working towards building an [ultralight pack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultralight_backpacking).

However, due to my height, the gear available to me is limited. When I thumb through [Backpacker magazine](http://www.backpacker.com/ "Backpacker Magazine - Your Backpacking, Hiking, Camping and Outdoor Gear Magazine")'s annual gear issue, I breeze past the shoes, jackets, shirts, pants, tents, sleeping bags, and packs because most of the items won't fit my long body.

Over the last 6 years, I've gradually made my pack lighter and lighter. Along the way, I've learned a good amount about what will and won't work for an unusually tall backpacker. I am trying to share that information here in hopes that others can benefit.

At the same time, I'm far from satisfied with the gear I have in my pack. I would love for you to join the conversation about how the ultratall can enjoy the backcountry. Please leave your comments at the bottom of the page or email me: tdhopper@gmail.com.

## My gear

### Pack

I carry a tall [ZPacks 54L Arc Zip](http://www.zpacks.com/backpacks/arc_zip.shtml). It cost me $324.00 in 2015. It weights 1.3 lbs. It's very comfortable, and I love it.

##### Notes

<small>Before I started transitioning to ultralight backpacking, I carried a [ULA Catalyst](http://www.ula-equipment.com/product_p/catalyst.htm "CATALYST  SHIPS FREE to US ADDRESSES"). It cost me $235.00 in 2009.</small>

### Sleeping quilt and mat

I use a custom quilt made by [Goosefeet Gear](https://goosefeetgear.com/). It is overstuffed with 850 FP DownTek, in 1.75" vertical baffles. There are snaps and a drawstring to create a footbox. Goosefeet sized it based on some measurements I gave them, and I am extremely happy with it. It weighs 1.5 lbs. It cost me $395 in 2014.

I use a [Gossamer Gear Airbeam Sleeper](http://gossamergear.com/air-beam-sleepers.html) inflatable pad in the wide, torso length size. It cost me about $100 in 2014. It weights 0.9 pounds. I sometimes carry a 3 oz foam pad for extra insulation.

##### Notes

<small>Buying sleeping pads isn't too difficult since they often don't need length of your body. Buying a bag or quilt is much hard. I highly recommend finding a small shop like Goosefeet Gear to make one to your specs.</small>

<small>Before getting the quilt, I had the enormous and warm Sierra Designs Paul Bunyan mummy bag. It weighs 4 lbs!</small>

<small>I talked to [Nunatak](https://nunatakusa.com/ "Nunatak Equipment") about a quilt. They said they'd do it for around $500. ZPacks and Feathered Friends said they wouldn't do a custom quilt.</small>

### Shelter

I sleep under a [Bearpawwd](http://www.bearpawwd.com/) 8'x10' silnylon, rectangular tarp pitched between two trekking poles. It weights 1.1 pounds. It cost me $71.00 in 2015.

On the ground, I have a 105"x48" piece of 0.007" thick Tyvek. It weighs 8 oz.

##### Notes

<small>Finding a tent that will fit me inside and keep me dry has been nearly impossible. An advantage of this shelter is that my wife and I can both fit under it easily.</small>

<small>Before I got the 8x10, I had a [MacCat Deluxe](http://www.outdoorequipmentsupplier.com/maccat_tarps.php) from Outdoor Equipment Supplier. It was big, but I was afraid that it wouldn't keep me dry in the rain due to the cut.</small>

<small>I am considering buying a customized sized, cuben fiber bivy from [Borah Gear](http://borahgear.com) as additional protection from wet ground and insects.</small>

<small>I have talked to some other manufacturers and modifying their tents. ZPacks and Hyperlite Mountain Gear are unable to customize tents on a one-off basis. [Yama Gear](http://www.yamamountaingear.com/) _is_ willing to add length to their Cirriform tents.</small>

<small>I [started a thread](https://backpackinglight.com/forums/topic/current-state-of-tents-for-the-very-tall) on the topic of tents for the very tall at BPL. It's worth reading through.</small>

### Trekking Poles

I carry the [Leki](http://usa.leki.com/ "Welcome page  All LEKI Technologies at a single glance - LEKI") Aergon poles. I hike with them and use them to pitch my tarp. I am happy with them.

### Clothes

Clothes are surprisingly hard to buy. I wish I could go buy everything [Andrew Skurka](http://andrewskurka.com/tag/core-13/) recommends, but most of it wouldn't fit me.

#### Trail Wear

Currently have the [Columbia Silver Ridge Convertible Pant](http://www.amazon.com/Columbia-Silver-Ridge-Convertible-36x34/dp/B0058YWPEM) in a 38x34. Buying hiking pants in a 34" inseam is easy; 36" is much harder. I have REI Sahara Medium Tall shirts in [long](https://www.rei.com/product/863048/rei-sahara-long-sleeve-t-shirt-mens-tall?cm_mmc=email_tran-_-rspu-_-20150415-_-itemdesc&RMID=RSPU_Sterling&RRID=28032313&ev11=) and [short](https://www.rei.com/product/863046/rei-sahara-t-shirt-mens-tall?cm_mmc=email_tran-_-rspu-_-20150401-_-itemdesc&RMID=RSPU_Sterling&RRID=28032313&ev11=) sleeve. REI has tragically stopped selling these; I bought two of each last year, thankfully. If anyone has a good alternative, please let me know. I typically wear [Under Armour Men's HeatGear Sonic Compression Shorts](http://smile.amazon.com/dp/B008BIC1TQ/ref=pe_385040_30332190_TE_dp_2) in a size Large.

#### Base Layer

I typically sleep in large, tall [Cabela's Men's E.C.W.C.S. Polar Weight Hoodie with Polartec Power Dry](http://www.cabelas.com/product/Cabelas-Mens-E-C-W-C-S-Polar-Weight-Hoodie-with-Polartec-Power-Dry-Tall/1900679.uts) or a [Cabela's Men's E.C.W.C.S. Power Dry Silk-Weight Crew with Polartec](http://www.cabelas.com/product/Cabelas-Mens-E-C-W-C-S-Power-Dry-Silk-Weight-Crew-with-Polartec-reg-Tall/1890756.uts) top; neither is long enough. I have a pair of black thermal pants that I've had for 10 years that I wear on my legs.


#### Rain Gear

I have a large, tall [Marmot PreCip Rain Jacket](https://www.rei.com/product/863345/marmot-precip-rain-jacket-mens-tall). It was soak through when I hiked in it 8 hours of heavy rain a few years ago, but it's great for light rain. I have a pair of cheap, generic rain pants I picked up somewhere along the way; they're not long enough.

I have considered a [cuben fiber](http://www.zpacks.com/accessories/groundsheet_poncho.shtml) [poncho](http://www.mountainlaureldesigns.com/shop/product_info.php?products_id=56) ($$$) or an [ultralight](http://snowpeak.com/products/ultra-light-grey-umbrella) [umbrella](http://gossamergear.com/chrome-umbrella.html), but have not invested in either.

#### Footwear

The shoe selection at size 16 is very limited. I hike in the Columbia North Plains Vent shoe; they're fine. I have some Keen: Targhee II Mid boots I used to backpack in; they're very light, which is nice.

I don't have any trouble with XL socks; they typically say for feet up to size 16, but they fit my size 16 feet. I typically wear wool quarter socks.

#### Other

I carry a $20 [NWT Men's HAWKE & CO Packable Down vest](http://www.ebay.com/itm/-/221345899344?ssPageName=ADME:L:OC:US:3160) that I bought on eBay a few years ago. It's not long enough to be fashionable, but it's cheap, light, and warm; I highly recommend having one.

I don't have a [wind shirt](http://sectionhiker.com/what-is-a-wind-shirt/) and haven't been able to find anything that has sufficiently long sleeves and waist; I would love to have something for windy mountain tops and running on windy mornings. The large Patagonia Houdini Jacket didn't fit me. I have considered trying a [ZPacks Ventum](http://www.zpacks.com/accessories/wind_shell.shtml).


[^torso]: My legs aren't _that_ long given my height. My height comes mostly from a long torso. It makes finding shirts especially hard.
